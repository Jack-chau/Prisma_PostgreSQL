# README for Prisma

Prisma is an open-source database toolkit that provides a type-safe ORM (Object Relational Mapping) layer for your database. It supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB.

## Installation

To install Prisma, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. In case you do not have them installed check out the official Node.js website and follow their instructions on how to install Node.js and npm. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install Prisma by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install prisma --save-dev

```

## Usage

To use Prisma in your project, you need to define your data model in a Prisma schema file (usually named `schema.prisma`). Here's an example of a simple schema file:

```
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

```

This schema file defines a data model for a `User` entity with four fields (`id`, `email`, `name`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`). You can customize and define your own data model, and Prisma will help you generate the appropriate code to interact with your database.

After defining your schema, you can generate the Prisma client by running the following command:

```
npx prisma generate

```

This will generate a `@prisma/client` module in your project directory that you can import and use in your code to interact with your database. The Prisma client provides a type-safe API to interact with your database, based on your schema definition.

Here's an example of how to use the Prisma client to create a new `User` entity:

```
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client')

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function createUser() {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: 'john.doe@example.com',
      name: 'John Doe',
    },
  })
  console.log(user)
}

createUser()

```

This code creates a new `User` entity in the database, with the email `john.doe@example.com` and the name `John Doe`. The `createUser` function uses the Prisma client to interact with the database and create the new entity.

## Conclusion

Prisma is a powerful and easy-to-use database toolkit that can help you build scalable and maintainable applications. With its type-safe ORM layer and support for multiple databases, Prisma can streamline your database operations and make your code more robust and reliable.
